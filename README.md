What is Ecoify all about?
=========================

Every time we ask google to search something for us, requests are sent
back and forth, Internet Service Providers need power to keep the
internet running and google needs power for their servers.

Careful estimates believe that each google search amounts to at least
0.4 Wh, which in turn amounts to no less than 0.2 g of CO2.

We want to cut down your own carbon footprint by preventing unneccessary
google searches:

Every time you enter the name of your favourite website and the browser
triggers a google search, we intercept it and instead open the page
directly for you - while also saving your time and reducing your CO2
emissions!
